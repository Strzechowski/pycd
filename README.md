pycd is a simple program to look through file tree

Idea is that user will be able to see a list of files in current directory, like this:

Path: /path/to/dir
    FileA
--> FileB
    DirectoryX
    FileC

User will be able to select file or directory with arrows.
User will be able to open the directory and maybe somehow interact with the files.
